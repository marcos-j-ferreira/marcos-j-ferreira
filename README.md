# Marcos Junior

I investigate how simple computational units scale into systems capable of language, reasoning and abstraction.

Researcher and LLM enthusiast focused on deep learning — exploring how a single artificial neuron, when structured and optimized at scale, can give rise to architectures that resemble cognition.

Currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development (IFSC).  
My essays and research notes are published on my website.
